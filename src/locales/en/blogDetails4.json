    "li": {
      "1": "Developing and implementing the chat feature requires integration with the existing system of the app, including databases, order management systems, and related services like push notifications and GPS tracking. This can be complex due to the need to ensure compatibility between different systems, avoiding conflicts or errors during operation. To implement successfully, the development team needs to thoroughly understand the current architecture of the app and plan in detail for integrating the chat feature."
    }
  },
  "23": {
    "li": {
      "1": "The chat feature needs to operate stably and respond quickly to provide a good experience for users. However, maintaining this stability is not simple, especially as the number of users and interactions increases. Issues such as delays in sending and receiving messages, connection errors, or even system crashes can occur. To address this, investment in a robust server infrastructure and the use of performance optimization techniques such as load balancing, caching, and backup systems are necessary."
    }
  },

    "li": {
      "1": "One of the major challenges when implementing the chat feature is ensuring that it operates smoothly across various devices and operating system versions. Users may use the app on Android, iOS, or other devices with different configurations and software versions. This requires the chat feature to be thoroughly tested on different platforms and devices to ensure that no errors or unexpected issues occur.",
      "2": "Additionally, supporting older operating system versions is also a challenge, as new APIs or libraries may not be compatible with these versions. This requires alternative solutions or redesigning some parts of the feature to ensure compatibility."

  },
  "25": {
    "li": {
      "1": "Interaction between drivers and customers through the chat feature needs to be managed professionally to avoid undesirable issues such as misunderstandings, disputes, or inappropriate behavior. One of the main challenges is ensuring that both parties communicate with each other respectfully and professionally.",
      "2": "To address this issue, measures such as filtering inappropriate language, providing message templates to guide communication, or even establishing communication rules that users must adhere to may be necessary. Additionally, providing a reporting and handling mechanism for communication incidents is also essential to maintain a positive and safe communication environment.",
      "3": "Finally, a monitoring and timely support system from the customer service team is required to handle situations that arise during the communication process between drivers and customers. This helps ensure that any issues are resolved quickly, avoiding impact on user experience and overall service quality."
